# Horiseon SEO website

## Description

The site is a SEO, ditigal and social media marketing website, which offers solutions for all your needs.

# Challenges 
The motivation for this repo was the corection of some loose and out of place HTML and CSS elements as well as the addition of alt tags to the images to help with accessability.
The project was built as a working SEO marketing website with the modifactions asked by the client.
I learnt that not code must be taken for granted and you can tidy the code left, so not repeating useless blocks and combining them into more managemable formats. Thus solving the problems the customer has asked for in making the site more accesable to differnt users.

The main problems in the HTML fixed where the lack of structure such as there was no Header, Foote, Sections (which I deemed was best suited to be an article as it has the bulk of the infomation in that one section )nor an Aside which have now been recified.
The CSS was tidied up thus grouping elements with the same properties within one block thus making it easier to read and Sorted the slight color differnce by asigning the same Hex Color to the aside, thus making the site on the same color pallette.

# Things I learned
most importamtally that changing one thing incorrectly can lead to a whole lot of problems, this was true for the HTML and CSS side. Some times it best to just start from scratch and just redo from a fresh reset and when struggling go for a walk and try and come up with a solution without staring at a screen.

# The site is starting up a bit to slow and am sure this could be due image compression images and maybe too many elements in the code. (not sure if this needed to be fixed?)
